                        The term “free proxy” or “free VPN” is misleading. Companies providing “free” proxies or VPNs aren’t just doing so out of the goodness of their hearts. In order to provide free or open proxies/VPNs, companies need to have large quantities of bandwidth—and that bandwidth is absolutely not free. So how are these companies paying for their bandwidth if they’re not charging their users?

                        Their solutions range from annoying inconveniences (random online advertisements, slow/unstable Internet connections), to using your data against you (targeted ads, spam), to sometimes something more sinister like stealing your confidential information (credit card or banking details, usernames and passwords, private photos).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By browsing the web unsecurely, you are allowing these types of companies to harvest your information and use it however they please.

                        “No matter whose network you’re using to go online, if you want to maximize your privacy... using a VPN (virtual private network) has become a viable option even for casual web users.” — Forbes

                        Why VPNs <i><u>Should</u></i> Cost Money
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Maintaining servers is expensive. Finding and keeping talented people who are knowledgeable and care about security and online privacy is also expensive (and the right thing to do). Providing even the lowest level of customer experience still requires companies to pay up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Think of it this way:</strong> the less money companies invest in their security and privacy products, the fewer resources they have to protect their users and servers against cyber criminal attacks or unlawful snooping.

                                            Best ones commonly offer 256-bit SSL encryption security (if you don’t understand what this means, just know that you need to encrypt your data and finding a company that offers this level of encryption solves that problem)

                                            Many claim high speeds, but only few deliver. But honestly, high-speed proxies aren’t worth the security risk.

                                            The VPN industry is big—and growing. If a company cannot offer fast speeds, it gets left behind. Economics push paid VPN companies to fiercely and continually optimize their server speeds.

                                            Websites can very easily bypass proxies and find out your real IP address. Since your online activities go through the proxies unencrypted, they are able to know everything you’re doing on your browser—and where you’re located.

                                            Depends on the type of proxy, and how well they handle their server load.

                                            Companies in the space work very hard to keep their servers stable, often purchasing multiple servers in one country to ensure uninterrupted connections.

                                            How are they able to legitimately provide a free service if they have high operational costs? There is a reason why many free proxies on <a href="https://www.top-proxies.co.uk/" title="Top Proxies">this list</a> are less than a month old.

                                            Free proxies can’t afford to hire people to help solve your connection problems.

                        So... which VPN should I use?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        I’ve tried several of the top paid VPNs on <a href="https://www.bestvpn.com/top-10-vpn-providers/" title="Best VPN">BestVPN.com</a>, and they’re alright. I’ve been using <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/" title="Express VPN">ExpressVPN</a> for over a year now, and they do exactly what I need them to. You should do your own digging, though.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The important thing is not settling for proxies or VPNs that claim to be “free”. Why compromise your online security and privacy just to save a few bucks a month?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Is it worth the risk? Won’t it cost you more in the long run?
